# Poisson-based-prediction
This project is a prediction algorithm based on poisson distribution model.


The problem explained:

I have generated a dataset which consists of calls scattered throughout different times of the day. Using this dataset, the model is trained to predict when the most number of calls are likely to occur based on patterns in the data. These patterns are identified using poisson distribution and the calls are predicted based on this. relying on the predicted data, we decide at what time the most number of ambulance should be scheduled. Basically distribution of workload to provide employmet opportunities in different shifts.
